**A Centralized Project Gallery**

The Brainhack Global team aims to create a (de)centralized collaborative working
platform that would facilitate & increase across-site collaborations and
interactions while also giving visibility to the projects run under Brainhack
Global as much as possible. We encourage sharing ideas, experiences and
knowledge across parties, removing the barriers and allowing contributions by
researchers from all around the globe and a myriad of disciplines.

If you would like to submit a project, please do so by
[opening an issue here](https://github.com/brainhackorg/global2021/issues/new/choose)
or reading the submission guidelines [down below the gallery](#guidelines) to
get more details.
